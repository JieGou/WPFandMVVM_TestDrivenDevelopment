# WPF and MVVM: Test Driven Development of ViewModels

Project source code for Pluralsight's course [WPF and MVVM: Test Driven Development of ViewModels](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/wpf-mvvm-test-driven-development-viewmodels
).

I've deviated a little from the course code, the major differences are:

* I'm using the MVVMLight framework where applicable. This means I'm using MVVMLight's Messenger instead of Prism's EventAggregator.
* I'm using NUnit instead of xUnit for all Unit tests.

This was an incredibly useful course, and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone learning WPF/MVVM.
